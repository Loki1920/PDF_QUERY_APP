### **Project Title**  
**PDF Parsing and Query App Using LlamaParse and LanceDB**

### **Executive Summary**  
This project aims to develop a PDF parsing and querying application that allows users to upload PDF files, extract structured data based on specific instructions, and perform semantic queries. Leveraging tools like LlamaParse, LanceDB Vector Store, and OpenAI, this solution will provide an interactive interface to streamline the extraction of complex financial data and allow for efficient querying of the indexed content.

### **Problem Statement**  
Many industries rely on documents like financial reports, legal papers, or research papers that contain critical data embedded in long and complex formats. Extracting and querying this data manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated solutions for parsing such structured and unstructured data from PDFs and making it queryable can significantly improve workflow efficiency.

### **Project Objectives**  
1. **Automated Parsing**: Automatically extract structured data (e.g., fund performance, event dates, project details) from uploaded PDF files.
2. **Efficient Indexing**: Store the parsed data in a LanceDB vector store for fast querying.
3. **Advanced Querying**: Use natural language queries to retrieve precise information with context-aware results, enhanced by a reranking system.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive web app using Streamlit for easy file upload and interaction.

### **Project Scope**
- **In-Scope**:
  - Parsing PDF files based on custom instructions.
  - Indexing the parsed data for fast, semantic search.
  - Handling financial data, fund performance, and key dates.
  - Displaying results in a user-friendly interface.
- **Out-of-Scope**:
  - Parsing documents other than PDFs.
  - Handling handwritten text or scanned images in PDFs.

### **Methodology/Approach**  
1. **File Upload and Parsing**:
   - Users upload a PDF file through the Streamlit interface.
   - LlamaParse is used to parse the PDF based on detailed instructions focused on financial metrics, dates, and events.
   
2. **Indexing with LanceDB**:
   - Parsed data is indexed into LanceDB for fast and efficient querying.
   
3. **Query Engine Setup**:
   - The app integrates a query engine with a Flag Embedding Reranker to improve search results by reranking based on semantic relevance.
   
4. **Querying**:
   - Users can input natural language queries, and the app retrieves and displays relevant data in a tabular format when appropriate.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: LlamaParse, LanceDB, LlamaIndex, OpenAI API, Streamlit
- **Environment**: Streamlit for front-end, local file storage for PDF uploads, LanceDB for vector storage

### **Timeline**  
| **Milestone**                   | **Estimated Duration** |  
|----------------------------------|------------------------|  
| Project setup and environment    | 1 week                 |  
| PDF parsing implementation       | 2 weeks                |  
| LanceDB integration              | 1 week                 |  
| Query engine with reranker setup | 2 weeks                |  
| Testing and optimization         | 1 week                 |  
| Final deployment and demo        | 1 week                 |  

### **Budget and Costs**  
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Streamlit Hosting: Free for basic usage, scalable if required.
  - LanceDB Vector Store: Costs may vary depending on scale.
  - OpenAI API: Pay-per-use, based on query volume.
- **Development Cost**: Based on man-hours for development and testing.

### **Risk Analysis**  
- **Technical Limitations**: 
  - Issues may arise with complex PDFs that deviate from the standard structure.
  - Dependence on external APIs (e.g., OpenAI) may incur additional costs.
- **Mitigation**: Use fallback solutions for simpler query processing and carefully monitor costs for scaling.

### **Benefits and Impact**  
- **Increased Efficiency**: Automates the extraction and querying process, reducing manual work.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces errors in data extraction and makes information retrieval more reliable.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Users with no technical background can interact with complex documents using simple queries.

### **Conclusion**  
This project presents a valuable solution for industries that handle large amounts of structured data in PDF formats, particularly in the finance sector. By providing an automated parsing and querying system, it will streamline workflows, save time, and enhance the accuracy of information retrieval.
